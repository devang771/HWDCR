# Handwritten Digit & Character Recognition System

A Minimalist's Neural Network which is Simple, Flexible, Powerful &
Implementation which can be trained on the CPU.

## Road Map :)

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Create the model.
4. Train the model.
5. Analyze the model.
6. Create GUI to predict digits.

## What is a Machine Learning Model

- A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain
  types of patterns.

- You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can
  use to reason over and learn from those data.

## Dependencies

### 1. Why TensorFlow

- TensorFlow offers multiple levels of abstraction so you can choose the right
  one for your needs.

- Build and train models by using the high-level Keras API, which makes getting
  started with TensorFlow and machine learning.

- If you need more flexibility, eager execution allows for immediate iteration
  and intuitive debugging.

- For large ML training tasks, use the Distribution Strategy API for distributed
  training on different hardware configurations without changing the model definition.

### 2. Why NumPy

- Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting
  concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.

- NUMERICAL COMPUTING TOOLS\
  NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators,
  linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.

- INTEROPERABLE\
  NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well
  with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.

### 3. Why OpenCV

- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision
  and machine learning software library.

- The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a
  comprehensive set of both classc and state-of-the-art computer vision and
  machine learning algorithms.

- These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects,
  classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects,
  extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras,
  stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene.

- It has C++, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux,
  Android and Mac OS.

- OpenCV is written natively in C++ and has a templated interface that works
  seamlessly with STL containers.

### 4. Why Keras Application Programming Interface

- Simple. Flexible. Powerful

- Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines.

- Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers
  consistent & simple APIs.

- It minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it
  provides clear & actionable error messages.
